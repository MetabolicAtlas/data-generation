# Data generator for Metabolic Atlas

## Prerequisites

 * [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) >= 1.22 (usage of yarn can be found
   [here](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/#toc-default-commandl))
 * [node.js](https://nodejs.org) >= v12

## Generating data

Neo4j data can be generated by running the following command

    $ ./generate <PATH TO DATA FILES>

This will install NPM packages and create
the folders `neo4j`, `dataOverlay`, and `gemRepository` under the current directory.
`<PATH TO DATA FILES>` should point to data files from this [repository](https://github.com/MetabolicAtlas/data-files).

The folder `neo4j` contains CSV files along with the [Cypher](https://neo4j.com/developer/cypher/) instructions to import the data.

The folder `dataOverlay` contains TSV and JSON files that can be served directly in [Metabolic Atlas](https://github.com/MetabolicAtlas/MetabolicAtlas).

The folder `gemRepository` contains a timeline chart for integrated models that can be served in [Metabolic Atlas](https://github.com/MetabolicAtlas/MetabolicAtlas).

Please note that while the aforementioned commands can be run on their own, the
output is meaningful only for the deployment pipeline of [Metabolic Atlas](https://github.com/MetabolicAtlas/MetabolicAtlas).
