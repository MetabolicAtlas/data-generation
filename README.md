# Data generator for neo4j

## Instructions

### Prerequisites

 * [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) >= 1.22
 * [node.js](https://nodejs.org) >= v12

### Generating data

Neo4j data can be generated by first running the following command to install NPM packages

    $ yarn

and then by

    $ yarn start <PATH TO DATA FILES>


After that, a folder `data/` will be created under the current directory. This folder `data/` contains CSV files along with the cypher instructions to import the data. \<PATH TO DATA FILES\> should point to data files from this [gitrepo](https://github.com/MetabolicAtlas/data-files)
