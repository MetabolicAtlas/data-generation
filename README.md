# Data generator for Metabolic Atlas

## Prerequisites

 * [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) >= 1.22 (usage of yarn can be found
   [here](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/#toc-default-commandl))
 * [node.js](https://nodejs.org) >= v12

## Generating data

Neo4j data can be generated by first running the following command to install
NPM packages

    $ yarn

and then by

    $ yarn start <PATH TO DATA FILES>


After that, the folders `neo4j` and `dataOverlay` will be created under the current directory.

The folder `neo4j` contains CSV files along with the [Cypher](https://neo4j.com/developer/cypher/) instructions to import the data.

The folder `dataOverlay` contains TSV and JSON files that can be served directly in [Metabolic Atlas](https://github.com/MetabolicAtlas/MetabolicAtlas).

`<PATH TO DATA FILES>` should point to data files from this [repository](https://github.com/MetabolicAtlas/data-files).

Please note that while the aforementioned commands can be run on their own, the
output is meaningful only for the deployment pipeline of [Metabolic Atlas](https://github.com/MetabolicAtlas/MetabolicAtlas).
