# Data generator for neo4j



## Prerequisites

 * [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) >= 1.22 (usage of yarn can be found
   [here](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/#toc-default-commandl))
 * [node.js](https://nodejs.org) >= v12

## Generating data

Neo4j data can be generated by first running the following command to install
NPM packages

    $ yarn

and then by

    $ yarn start <PATH TO DATA FILES>


After that, a folder `data/` will be created under the current directory. This
folder `data/` contains CSV files along with the cypher instructions to import
the data. \<PATH TO DATA FILES\> should point to data files from this
[gitrepo](https://github.com/MetabolicAtlas/data-files)

Please note that while the aforementioned commands can be run on their own, the
output is meaningful only for the deployment pipeline of the whole
MetabolicAtlas.
